# Debugging

## Logging
You can write messages to the system log using static methods in the `Log` class. Since we are debugging we will use `Log.d` to send a debug message.  

## Exceptions and Stack Traces
- Use the DDMS tool window to see what happened
- Provides a stack trace

## Process
- Set a breakpoint by clicking in the margin next to the line numbers
- Start Debugging by choosing debug (not run) in the toolbar
- Step through code using the buttons in the logcat at the bottom of the window
- Check value of variables in the Debug window

## Android Lint
- Static analyzer for Android code
- Finds errors before you run
  - Not syntax errors
- Run Analyze-Inspect Code
